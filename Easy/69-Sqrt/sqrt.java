        Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

        Example 1:
        Input: x = 4
        Output: 2
        Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
       
        Example 2:
        Input: x = 8
        Output: 2
        Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
